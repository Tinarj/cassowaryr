This package has been previously submitted but was rejected because it had an ACM license. Since alphahull has updated and replaced its dependence on tripack with interp allowing it to have a GLP licence. We have updated our package and also use a GLP license, rectifying the issue with our original submission.

This is a package for computing scagnostics available on CRAN, scagnostics. However, this is built on C code that cannot be debugged, and rJava, which makes the scagnostics not easily available on all platforms. For this reason we have written the code to compute them from scratch, which also will allow others to develop further.
