This is a new package submission

We have addressed the problems with initial submission. There is no associated paper with this package so we didn't add anything for that section. We also added value descriptions to all the functions. Slight adjustments to some of the draw functions were also added.

We have added a citation to a paper that describes some of the scagnsotic methods. 

We have changed the license to just read ACM. Thank you for bringing the licensing issue to our attention, we are now working on an alternative to the alphahull and tripack packages, which we will implement in the 2.0 version of the package.
