This is a new package submission

We have addressed the problems with initial submission. There is no associated paper with this package so we didn't add anything for that section. We also added value descriptions to all the functions. Slight adjustments to some of the draw functions were also added.

We have added a citation to a paper that describes some of the scagnsotic methods. 
 
We have changed the license to just read ACM. Thank you for bringing the licensing issue to our attention, we are now working on an alternative to the alphahull and tripack packages, which we will implement in the 2.0 version of the package. 

There were 2 notes from the tests. First was for the license file which is no longer being used and has now been deleted. The second looks as though it is for the spelling of scagnostic, which is not mispelt, so this note is not a real issue with the package.

We see that the alphahull package has been revised. We would like to resubmit cassowaryr, considering it was originally rejected because of its ACM license. A license it has because of a dependency on alphahull. With alphahull's renewal we can only assume that is no longer an issue. Additionally, alphahull only seems to have this license because it is dependent on tripack, and if this package if replaced with a FOSS package, alphahull (and thus cassowaryr) will be able to swap to an open source license.
