Description: Computes a range of scatterplot diagnostics (scagnostics)
  on pairs of numerical variables in a data set. A range of
  scagnostics is provided including graph-based (as described by
  Leland Wilkinson and Graham Wills (2008) <doi:10.1198/106186008X320465>),
  including convex, clumpy, outlying, skinny, striated, and
  association-based (described in the PhD thesis of Katrin Grimm), including
  splines and dcor. Summary and plotting functions are included.
